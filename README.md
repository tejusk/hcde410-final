### Abstract

For this project, I analyzed the relationship between a country's economic/demographic profile and its progress with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. My goal with the project was to gain a clearer quantitative understanding of global vaccine progress. My research questions investigated the correlation with vaccine distribution for GDP per capita and net migration, respectively. I performed my analysis using two publicly-available datasets: one containing general facts about each country, and the other a regularly-updated log of vaccine progress per country. I found that GDP per capita bears a significant positive correlation with countries' vaccine distribution, and that net migration has a similarly positive (albeit weaker) correlation with immunization. Below my findings, I discuss possible explanatory threads for these trends and disparities in vaccine rollout. I've intended for this project to act as a stepping stone for a broader qualitative investigation on world progress with the vaccine.
