    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm interested in tracking worldwide progress on the COVID-19 vaccine. I'm personally drawn to the topic because I feel I have not kept myself as up-to-date on COVID data (on a societal level) as I should, and because I have friends and relatives living overseas. On a broader level, it is valuable to understand the different rates of vaccination progress between world regions in order to root out potential inequities in vaccine distribution. I am comparing vaccination data with economic and population statistics on each country to identify correlations with vaccine progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "World progress on the COVID vaccine is currently being studied by a number of research and news organizations, including [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/international), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/health/global-covid-vaccinations/). However, these public vaccine trackers simply provide information similar to what is described in my first dataset (see below), whereas I am more interested in correlating this data with a country's economic and demographic profile to discover potential correlations. I am mainly doing so to find the quantitative basis behind existing inequities in vaccine distribution, which have been covered in more policy-based reporting such as [this article by NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/17/988302407/what-can-wealthy-nations-do-to-address-global-vaccine-inequity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses / Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Countries with a lower GDP per capita will have lower total vaccinations.\n",
    "* Countries with a higher GDP per capita will have a higher daily rate of vaccinations.\n",
    "* What effect does migration rate have on vaccination progress?\n"

    "## Data\n",
    "I am primarily using a Kaggle dataset called [COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress). The dataset is a compilation (updated daily) of entries from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) GitHub repository, which tracks vaccinations by country. The dataset is licensed to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 dedication. I find the dataset suitable for my research given its thoroughness and detail: it sorts its entries by a number of relevant variables including (but not limited to) country, date, and vaccination counts sorted by daily rate, usage, and various population proportions. I don't anticipate any privacy violations given that the data is just a series of counts and averages across countries rather than information about individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am comparing this data to the [Countries of the World](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) dataset, which compiles various general facts about each world nation (including GDP per capita, population, population density, and net migration). This dataset is also licensed to the public domain under Creative Commons. Cross-referencing my first dataset with this one will allow me to investigate my hypotheses and research questions."

    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "All management of data was done through Microsoft Excel. My first step was to isolate the ``country_vaccinations`` dataset to only include the most recent total vaccinations for each country. I did this by first eliminating all blank rows from the ``total_vaccinations`` column, and saving that sheet in a separate file. I then isolated only the most recent entries for each country from this sheet and copied those entries to a second page on the sheet titled ``most_recent_total_vaccinations``, which gave me 214 entries to work with. This was 14 short of the 228 countries on the ``countries of the world`` dataset, which meant that there are 14 countries for which COVID vaccination data has not been recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this meant that I could not perform analyses on these 14 countries since there was no way for me to cross-reference information between datasets without the countries directly matching. Hence, I combined the two datasets (``most_recent_total_vaccinations`` and ``countries of the world``) into a single sheet, selected the columns representing country names for each respective dataset, and then highlighted unique values between the two to identify the mismatching countries. Controlling for spelling differences (ex: \"Boznia **and** Herzegovina\" as opposed to \"Bosnia **&** Herzegovina\"), I deleted the data from the rows where a country was not represented in both datasets. This ensured that the data between the two sets was aligned to the same countries. To verify, I added an extra column in the combined sheet and entered the formula `=A1=L1`, then applied it down the entire sheet. The formula returned `TRUE` for every row, which meant that the country data between the two datasets was correctly aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I had a combined spreadsheet with data aligned to each country, it was simply a matter of isolating my columns of interest and generating graphs based on that data. Based on my three hypotheses, the column pairs I compared were ``total_vaccinations`` vs. ``GDP ($ per capita)``, ``daily_vaccinations_raw`` vs. ``GDP ($ per capita)``, and ``total vaccinations`` vs. ``Net Migration``."
