    "I'm interested in tracking worldwide progress on the COVID-19 vaccine. I'm personally drawn to the topic because I feel I have not kept myself as up-to-date on COVID data (on a societal level) as I should, and because I have friends and relatives living overseas. On a broader level, it is valuable to understand the different rates of vaccination progress between world regions in order to root out potential inequities in vaccine distribution. From a scientific and sociological standpoint it would also be of interest to learn how countries' progress in recovering COVID is affecting their other, non-pandemic concerns, such as the effects of climate change."

    "## Data\n",
    "I am using a Kaggle dataset called [COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress). The dataset is a compilation (updated daily) of entries from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) GitHub repository, which tracks vaccinations by country. The dataset is licensed to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 dedication. I find the dataset suitable for my research given its thoroughness and detail: it sorts its entries by a number of relevant variables including (but not limited to) country, date, and vaccination counts sorted by daily rate, usage, and various population proportions. I don't anticipate any privacy violations given that the data is just a series of counts and averages across countries rather than information about individuals."

    "I intend to include a secondary component to my research identifying potential causal trends to the disparities in vaccine progress across nations. I will have to scope this analysis appropriately so that I am not answering research questions too broad to answer before the end of the quarter. Additionally, one of my unknowns is whether this dataset/research focus is too broad or generic to yield specific or novel inquiries about this issue. I may have to use additional datasets beyond just the one linked above to pursue more meaningful inquiries."
